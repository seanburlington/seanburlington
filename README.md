- 👋 Hi, I’m @seanburlington
- 👀 I’m interested in many aspects of web development (PHP, Laravel, Golang, JavaScript, React, Devops, QA) hands on, architecture, or team leading - I tend towards back end and behind the scenes work but with a full-stack and full lifecycle approach in defiance of silo working.
- 🌱 Stacks of experience across all types of organisation and team size
- 💞️ I’m looking for freelance/contract work
- 📫 Reach me on twitter personal at https://twitter.com/seanburlington
